## Introduction
An Interaction evolves from the concepts inherent in a
[UML Sequence Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram).
Instead of specifying those concepts in a visual way, as in UML, RIDDL 
specifies them in a textual way. The purpose of an interaction is to specify
an important way in which the system components communicate and cooperate to
accomplish a task that is valuable to the stakeholders of the system. 

As with the UML concept, an interaction shows the message flow between system
entities in time sequence. Interaction definitions are often derived from 
use cases, usage scenarios, work flows, or other repetitive patterns of usage
of the system. Their purpose is to show the intended flow of messages in order
to guide the development of the system or specify required communication between
system entities.
