Some definitions are fundamental to RIDDL and can appear in many RIDDL 
container definitions. Before exploring the hierarchy of definitions, we 
will define some things that are common to many definitions:

* [include](includes) - lexically including files into the current file
* [descriptions](descriptions) - describing definitions for documentation purposes
* [types](types) - defining types of information or data
* [examples](examples) - defining Gherkin examples to express testable behavior
* [expressions](expressions) - defining expressions in various places
* [functions](functions) - the syntax of a function body
* [import](imports) - importing definitions from a previous compilation
