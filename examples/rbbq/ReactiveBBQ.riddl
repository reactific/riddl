|A domain to encapsulate the entire enterprise named Reactive BBQ.
|It is divided into three subdomains:
|* Restaurant -- handles each of the restaurant locations
|* Back Office -- handles all the back office supplies and menus
|* Corporate -- handles the corporate web site, marketing, accounting and HR
|This domain definition is designed to be instructive in the RIDDL language.
|It uses the case study from the Lightbend Reactive Architecture course as
|the basis for defining the domain. The course uses a set of interviews with
|Reactive BBQ employees and customers to define the requirements. This domain
|specification is a possible result of analyzing that domain: the Reactive BBQ
|restaurant.
