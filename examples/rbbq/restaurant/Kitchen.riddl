    |## Brief
    |This is an OrderViewer

  |> The kitchen is where food is prepared"
  |The kitchen bounded context provides the ability for the kitchen staff
  |to interact with orders they are preparing. The kitchen is a client of
  |the orders bounded context and interacts with that context alone for
  |the outstanding orders to be prepared. Everything else that happens in
  |the kitchen is out of scope for the restaurant automation software.
  |Consequently, this bounded context is pretty minimal.
