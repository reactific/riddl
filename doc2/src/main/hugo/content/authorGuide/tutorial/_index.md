Some people can learn RIDDL faster by looking at examples than they can by reading the informal definitions in the [language guide](../language) or the formal definitions in the [grammar section](../grammar). To support that mode of learning, this tutorial decomposes the domain of a fictitous restaurant, The Reactive BBQ. 

As you will see, the Reactive BBQ is an expansive domain. As such, this tutorial will not attempt to have you specify the entire domain. Rather, we will work through each feature of the RIDDL language by considering examples from inside the Reactive BBQ domain. We have fully specified it so that you have a concrete reference implementation and the companion language references to guide you. You can find the fully implemented Reactive BBQ RIDDL specification here. The language reference can be found here.
