The intended audience is business owners, business analysts, domain engineers, and software architects. It is intentionally simple and readable. The language is free in its formatting. It does not require indentation and its various constructs can be arranged on any line. RIDDL supports the definition of a variety of concepts taken directly from Domain Driven Design and the Unified Modeling Language as well as software architecture.</description></item></channel></rss>
